		<h1>Ilya Methot Me</h1>
		<p>I walked into a bus tunnel and heard the entire space <em>GROWL</em></p>
		<p>I’ve read that haunted places are filled with low frequencies that bounce off the walls until they are only felt by the body. The roar of a lion also contains this low rumbling sound. The lack of sound can itself be a sound.</p>
		<h2>Some sounds I like:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Wind blowing through the side of the city that goes unnoticed</li>
			<li>The clink of silverware in a fancy restaurant</li>
			<li>An apple falling from a tree and hitting a ground covered in leaves</li>
			<li>The scream of a truck engine</li>
			<li>A singing guitar</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I take classes at Emerson College where I study Visual Media Arts.</p>
		<p>There I hope to find projects to apply different sounds in different forms of media:</p>
		<ul>
<li>Film</li>      <li>Web</li>      <li>Design</li>      <li>Art</li>       <li>Movement</li> </ul>
		<p>My favorite thing is to walk around with a shotgun microphone and headphones. It picks up a lot of cool individual sounds you wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. There was an air conditioner down some stairs that sounded like <em>wind</em> on mountains. I am currently making a program that reads hand movements and translates them into sound using the XBox Kinect.</p>
